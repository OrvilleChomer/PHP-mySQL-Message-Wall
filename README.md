# PHP mySQL Message Wall
Demonstrates my ability to create a full stack web site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and mySQL.

This is a single page application that works like a simplistic version of Facebook. There is no concept of Friends in this app (yet), but, you can sign up, and post messages/comments/replies on the wall. Posts show up in reverse-chronological order.

The original site was set up an Apache server using MAMP on my Mac.

I used phpMyAdmin to set up the database.
